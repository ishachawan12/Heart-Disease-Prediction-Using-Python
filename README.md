# Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. It employs various classification models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, and each model is evaluated for accuracy, with Random Forest emerging as the best performer. This project highlights the significance of data-driven approaches in healthcare diagnostics.
