# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Python
 This heart disease prediction project uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. After preprocessing and splitting the data, models were evaluated for accuracy. Random Forest performed best, highlighting the value of multivariate analysis in improving diagnostic efficiency.
